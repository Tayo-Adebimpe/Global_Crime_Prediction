GLOBAL CRIME PREDICTION
Crime and insecurity has become one of the major global problems and source of worries to many nations and governments. The rate of crimes is on the rise in many nations of the world. Terriorism, homicide, suicide, violence, man-slaughter, drug abuse, gun abuse, robbery, frauds, cyber crimes, kidnapping, sexual assults, political unrest and other forms of crimes are threatening economic activities, economic growth, peace and progress of many nations. These may be common in the developing nations but the developed nations have not been spared, a number of them are having a fair share of the large scale and coordinated crimes.

Hence, the project seeks to develop a ML Model that will accurately predict crimes in different nations of the world so as to help the crime fighters to prevent the crimes.

Using the United Nations' dataset on crimes from Kaggle, these are the objectives of the model:

What are the top 20 unsafe countries in the World?
what are the top 5 crimes in these 20 countries?
what is their rates of occurrence?
predict when these 5 crimes will occur
